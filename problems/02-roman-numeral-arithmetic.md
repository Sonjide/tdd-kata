# Passport Validation

## Problem Description

(This is a more advance problem.)

This [problem](02-roman-numeral-arithmetic.md) is from [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

You need to validate groups of fields and decide which ones represent a "valid" passport.

## Guidance

There is a second part to this which is revealed only when you have done the first part.

As this is quite a complex problem, take it step by step.

Start by parsing the data into a form that your domain (your business rules) can work with. So convert to numbers where you can.

You could use [Regular Expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions) for the validation.
